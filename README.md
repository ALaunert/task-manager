Certainly! Here's a coding challenge for a junior React developer:

Challenge: Build a Task Manager App

Requirements:

Create a task manager app where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. (done) <br>
Display a list of tasks with their respective completion status. (done) <br>
Include a form where users can add new tasks. (done) <br>
Implement delete functionality to remove tasks from the list. (done) <br>
Allow users to mark tasks as completed, updating their status accordingly. (done) <br>
Add styling to make the app visually appealing. (i'm bad at desing so it is what it is) <br>

Additional Optional Features:

Implement local storage functionality to persist tasks even after page refresh. (done) <br>
Allow users to filter tasks based on their completion status (e.g., all tasks, completed tasks, active tasks). (done) <br>
Add animation or transitions to enhance the user experience. (again, it is what it is) <br>
Implement responsive design to ensure the app is usable on different devices. (maybe there will be an update with responsive design) <br>

You can use any additional libraries or frameworks you prefer, such as Redux for state management, Material-UI for styling, or any other tools you are comfortable with.

Feel free to ask any questions if you need clarification on any of the requirements. Good luck with the challenge!
